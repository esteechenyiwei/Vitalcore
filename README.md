# Vitalcore
This repository showcases Vitalcore's Web App UI, a web app developed for UPenn Hospital's nurses, engineers and analysts. It is an integrated platform for showing the status, error messages and patient info stored in all devices in various schools' hospitals like UPenn Hospital (HUP), Princeton House, etc. It provides a visualized form of status data for easier comprehension and viewership by using tables, bar graphs, line charts, pie charts and donut charts that enable the users to grasp the trend of the data and generate insights efficiently.
